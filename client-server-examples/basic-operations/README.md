# Basic Operations Example

In this example a [Pivotal GemFire](https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire) / [Apache Geode](http://geode.apache.org/) client will be configured to perform the basic CRUD operations.

To run the example simply run the tests located under basic-operations/src/test in your IDE.

The client is configured to connect to the server on `localhost` port `40404`. There is no need to start the server separately, as that is taken care of by the test.

## Running the example

The example is broken up into multiple steps:
1. Insert (Put) three Customer entries into the `Customers` region using the repositories `save` method.
2. Print out the size of the local region in the cache.
3. Print out the size of the region on the server.
4. Update the Customer for id=2. Recording the before and after Customer detail.
5. Remove (delete) the Customer for id=3.

Your output from the test `repositoryWasAutoConfiguredCorrectly` should look similar to the following:
