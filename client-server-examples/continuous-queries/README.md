# Continuous Queries Example

In this example a [Pivotal GemFire](https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire) / [Apache Geode](http://geode.apache.org/) client will put data into the region on the server, and register a continuous query on that data.

To run the example simply run the tests located under continuous-queries/src/test in your IDE.

The client is configured to connect to the server on `localhost` port `40404`. There is no need to start the server separately, as that is taken care of by the test.

## Running the example

The example is broken up into multiple steps:
1. Insert (Put) three Customer entries into the `Customers` region using the repositories `save` method.
2. Print "Received message for CQ 'CustomerCQ'" for each item retrieved by the continuous query.

Your output from the test `continuousQueryWorkingCorrectly` should look similar to the following:
